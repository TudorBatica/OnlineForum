## Getting started

### API
The API implementation can be found in the `api/` directory. 
To use it:  
1. Restore `appsettings.json`  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ- in order to use the API, the `appsettings.json` file must be created, as it is not included in this repository.
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ- a file called `appsettingssample.json` has been included that illustrates how to create `appsettings.json`.  
2. Restore dependencies:  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ- use `dotnet restore`
3. Deployment:  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ- locally: use `dotnet watch run`; it will start at `https://localhost:5001` and `http://localhost:5000`.  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ- dockerize üê≥: `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` files are included.  
  
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: For testing purposes, the API has Cross-Origin Resource Sharing enabled for all hosts. This may represent a big security issue. CORS can be disabled in the `Startup.cs` file. You can read more about CORS risks in this [article](https://medium.com/@ehayushpathak/security-risks-of-cors-e3f4a25c04d7).

### Single Page Application

1. Restore `.env`  
2. Restore dependencies:
