## Getting started

### API
The API implementation can be found in the `api/` directory. 
1. Restore `appsettings.json`  
  - in order to use the API, the `appsettings.json` file must be created, as it is not included in this repository.
  - a file called `appsettingssample.json` has been included that illustrates how to create `appsettings.json`.  
2. Restore dependencies:  
  - use `dotnet restore`
3. Deployment:  
  - locally: use `dotnet watch run`; it will start at `https://localhost:5001` and `http://localhost:5000`.
  - dockerize üê≥: `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` files are included.
